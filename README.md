# Authentication System with React, Django, and JWT

## Project Overview

This project implements a secure authentication system using React for the frontend, Django for the backend, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. 
It was developed during my full-stack development internship at Prodigy Infotech. The system includes user registration, login, and token-based authorization 
to manage secure access to protected resources.

## Features

- User Registration: New users can sign up by providing valid credentials.
- User Login: Existing users can log in and receive a JWT for accessing protected routes.
- Secure APIs: Backend APIs are protected using JWT-based authentication.
- Token Refresh: Supports token refreshing to maintain session security.
- Responsive Frontend: Built with React for a user-friendly experience.
